;;; WITH-FRED-DRAWING
;;; _______________________________ 

;;; Why go through all the mess of writing such a hideous looking thing? Well, the fact
;;; that we added gWorld imaging capabilities to Fred is NOT ENOUGH to allow Fred to image
;;; into a port because frec draws itself assuming its topleft is at (0 0). All this macro
;;; does is to mess with the origin of the port we are drawing into so that when we call the
;;; frec drawing procedures, frec is in the right place. This has two parts: setting the origin
;;; and the correct clip (to account for other SK8 actors) and then resetting them to their
;;; original values. 

;;; NOTE TO THE BRAVE:
;;; A lot of weird stuff goes on in this macro. Do not mess with the stuff we do about the
;;; origin and the clipping or you'll regret it. If you do want to mess with stuff, make sure
;;; to always keep a copy of the version that worked somewhere. Also make sure you understand
;;; what you are doing before you change this. 

;;; If you are drawing into your window, make sure the port is still around at the end of the
;;; body.

;;; This variable record the port and the object that with-fred-drawing is dealing with.

;;; Migration Notes:
;;; ---------------

;;; In Beta 3 we introduce MCL 3.0's version of Fred which adds color. We had 
;;; previously added color ourselves by changing the representation of the fontlist in the buffer.
;;; The differences between Beta2's representation and Beta3's representation are:

;;; (1) In B2: a font is represented by a trio of numbers: the ff, the ms and the color.
;;;    In B3: a font is represented by a pair of numbers: the ff and the ms. The color is stored with them in some spare bits.

;;; (2) In B2: we store SK8 Colors in the :colors part of the properties slot. 
;;;         The format of this list is {color1, color2, ... , colorn}
;;;    In B3: the :colors part of the properties slot contains an association list.
;;;         The format is {{index1, color1}, {index2, color2}, ... , {indexn, colorn}}

;;; So, at initializeFromStore time, we decide whether the field we are looking at is of the old type.
;;; If so we remove all color information in both the font list and the color list. For each EditText to whom this happens
;;; a message is printed on the MessageBox. 
;;; ---------------

;;; This function returns t if every color in our color list is present as a third item
;;; in the font list of the buffer.

	Change History (most recent last):
	2	6/1/93	Hernan	Just trying stuff but in the end did not change anything.
	3	6/1/93	Hernan	PartnerScrollers are copied and partnered but are
				only affixed if the originals were!
	4	6/1/93	Hernan	Modified update-field-rect to use data from the
				low level rect (avoids problems with the textfield).
	5	6/10/93	Hernan	InitializeObject now updates the low-level field. 
				This was a problem for fields that are locked forever.
	6	6/11/93	Brian Roddy	
	7	6/15/93	Hernan	InitializeObject looks uses the low level rect to
				compute the size. This avoids problems with the
				textField, who is all screwed up anyway...
	8	6/21/93	Hernan	Just a little research...
	8	6/21/93	Hernan	Second try to check in!
	9	6/21/93	Hernan	SimpleText only passes mouseDown up the containement hierarchy
				when it is not locked!!!
	10	6/22/93	Hernan	unlockText now takes a force argument which
				really unlocks the field. Also, field-force-update
				does not draw if the field is locked.
	11	6/25/93	Hernan	The Great Renaming of 93.
	12	6/25/93	Hernan	InitializeObject -> initialize.
	13	6/26/93	kleiman	(ownedRegion -> (ownsRegion
	14	6/28/93	Hernan	Fixing improper renaming of ownedRegion -> ownsRegion.
	15	7/6/93	chip	
	20	8/31/93	hernan	Complete reimplementation of editText in order
				to increase efficiency and do away with all those
				zillions wptrs.
	21	9/1/93	hernan	The great integrating build for d4!!!
	22	9/3/93	hernan	Making lockText do the right thing: disallow the 
				user from changing the field by direct manipulation.
	23	9/14/93	chip	Defined update-fieldpartners on simpleText
				because it seems to get called somehow... It does
				nothing.
	24	9/22/93	hernan	Fixed update-partnerScroller to work with the
				new improved scroller.
	25	9/22/93	kleiman	initialize-internal
	26	9/28/93	rod	removed getfromuser
	27	10/1/93	hernan	=====================================
				= Sad but true: the node is gone!!! =
				=====================================
	28	10/4/93	kleiman	initialize peek
	29	10/5/93	hernan	with-fast-slots -> with-fast-node-slots.
	30	10/8/93	hernan	PrepareForStage now takes care of setting the
				field's window.
	31	11/1/93	hernan	Use withResourceFile instead of usingResourceFileName...
	32	11/3/93	hernan	Fixing pointOnWhichPart to return the right char index.
	33	11/19/93	hernan	Making editText activate itself when it is moused
				on. This is not happening when the edittext was
				deactivated but is still the keyTarget of its window.
	34	11/29/93	chip	(setf partnerScroller) now uses its orientation arg when creating the mapValue handler; initialize now uses SK8-multival-bind for gs:rect-size
	35	12/3/93	sidney	Allow save and load of projects with ScriptEditText objects
	36	12/5/93	sidney	Move definition of a handler for ScriptEditText to where it loads after the class is defined
	37	12/21/93	hernan	Making sure we have a region before we try to
				dispose it.
	38	12/21/93	hernan	Error checking trap stuff.
	39	1/7/94	hernan	Making editText use the currentCursor property
				to set the cursor of the stage.
	40	1/10/94	hernan	Fonts just became objects!!!
	41	1/10/94	hernan	Stupid typo.
	42	1/11/94	hernan	self -> me
	43	1/14/94	hernan	Now using ports to talk to scrollers!
	44	1/17/94	hernan	Separating out the part of initialize that makes
				the low level field so that it may be called from
				other places.
	45	2/12/94	kleiman	name changes
	46	2/21/94	hernan	The Final Renaming for Alpha! (yeah, right...)
	47	2/21/94	hernan	window -> sk8::window.
	48	2/25/94	hernan	Using symbols instead of keywords for options!!!
	49	2/28/94	hernan	Now using GCable mac pointers and handles!
	50	3/2/94	Hernan	Porting to Fred 3.0
	51	3/3/94	Hernan	The great handler argument name renaming of 94!
	52	3/3/94	kleiman	properties -> addproperty
	53	3/3/94	kleiman	private properties declared via makeprivateproperty
	54	3/4/94	kleiman	ed-fred -> edData
	55	3/6/94	Hernan	Making editText conform with the final API.
	56	3/6/94	chip	now also has Text as a parent
	57	3/6/94	Hernan	Making wrapping editText update scrollers on'
				idle only!
	58	3/6/94	Hernan	EditText and scrollers shall behave!!! (some day...)
	59	3/14/94	Hernan	Making the text attributes be changed properly 
				when the field has no text. Had to define our own
				version of buffer-replace-font-spec which really
				replaces the thing.
	60	3/14/94	kleiman	makePrivateProperty -> (setf (private ...
	61	3/15/94	Hernan	Fixed handlers that change the text style, font
				and size to pass a whole new font spec to the 
				lower level function. The idea is to stop MCL from
				merging fonts since that is not the SK8 way.
	62	3/18/94	Hernan	Making horizontalScroll be 0 when a negative
				number is passed.
	63	3/21/94	sidney	duplicate -> copy
	64	3/24/94	Hernan	Fixing horizontal scrolling. We forgot to update 
				the thumbview in updatePartnerScroller.
	65	3/25/94	Hernan	Fixing thumbview setting problem.
	66	3/29/94	sidney	Fixing scriptEditText-draw to correctly set the
				port before copying to the gWorld. (Hernan)
	67	3/30/94	Hernan	Nothing, just checking in so that this file will
				be recompiled in next build.
	68	3/31/94	Hernan	All calls to low level frec functions have to be
				done within a port (otherwise the current port
				is used and the current port might be the wmgr
				port!!!). This may be the cause of the font problem.
	69	3/31/94	Hernan	Fixing forceRedraw to blit the to the ownedRegion
				(not the fillRegion).
	70	4/1/94	Hernan	Before copy-bits set the foreColor and the
				backColor.
	71	4/5/94	kleiman	code review: made publi api
	72	4/15/94	Hernan	Kludged ed-next-line-pos-wrapped to put the
				cursor in the last character when at the end of
				the buffer.
	73	4/15/94	rod	Fixing HighlightColor for all pickers and edittext...
	74	4/22/94	Hernan	Fixed bug in merge-with-current-font-spec.
	75	4/26/94	Hernan	Removing extraneous print statement.
	76	6/13/94	Hernan	Removing the continuation character from the 
				comtab that editText uses.
	77	7/1/94	Hernan	1169264: adding the set selection handler.
	78	7/13/94	Hernan	The text translator's internalObject is String
				(not Text).
	79	7/13/94	Hernan	1172953: Fixing it!
	80	7/18/94	Hernan	1174339: Since Fred always merges fonts, had to
				kludge set textStyle to set the style to plain
				before changing the style to what the user really
				wants.
	81	7/22/94	chip	main parent of EditText is now EditTextCollection (radar #1171748)
	82	8/5/94	Hernan	1178348: forceRedraw should to the usual actor
				stuff when the editText is a window.
	83	8/5/94	Hernan	Got rid of silly looking references to the
				*scrolling* variable in the code.
	84 	 8/12/94	Hernan  	Changing ed-fred-default-key-handler to let
							you insert tab characters into fields.
	85 	 8/22/94	Hernan  	1181072: textFont of EditText now returns a font 
							object (instead of a string).
	86 	 8/31/94	Hernan  	scrollerOrientation -> orientation.
	87 	 9/ 2/94	Hernan  	1183700: Setting *editText-the-object* to the
							EditText as soon as it is created.
	88 	 9/13/94	till    	Bug 1183148, fix set-editText-style-aspect to 
							set the defaulfont.
	89 	 9/16/94	Hernan  	Making the textFont of EditText be Geneva.
	90 	 9/28/94	Hernan  	EditText now copies its text and draws its contents.
	91 	10/ 3/94	Hernan  	Adding the paper argument to render. (The paper
							is the Port at this point).
	92 	10/ 7/94	chip    	added localCreationRelations to EditText & fixed its initialize as needed
	93 	10/13/94	chip    	updated (setf partnerScroller) to use set-partnerScroller
	94 	10/17/94	dy      	ownedRegion is now in p-list
	95 	10/20/94	chip    	added call-with-temp-string handler
	96 	10/21/94	dy      	incr/decrOwnsRegionCount -> incr/decrementOwnsRegionCount
	97 	11/ 4/94	Hernan  	Adding changes to allow EditText to draw straight
							into the gWorld.
	98 	11/ 5/94	Hernan  	Kludged handleKey to avoid the flashing scrollbar
							problem.
	99 	11/ 4/94	Till    	copy-ed-fred change for color fred.
	100	11/ 4/94	till    	Color fred, sk8-buffer-replace-font-codes.
	101	11/ 4/94	till    	backoff of color for a moment
	102	11/ 8/94	Hernan  	Trying to avoid costly redraws while fixing the
							lingering cursor problem...
	103	11/ 9/94	Hernan  	1198239: wordUnderMouse should ask for the
							view-mouse-position with the port focused on the
							editText's window.
	104	11/10/94	Hernan  	new-fred makes the selection region as well.
	105	11/14/94	Hernan  	1199094: fixing the messagebox colorDepth crash
							by changing with-fred-drawing to resample the
							port before reseting the origin. This has to be done
							because the port might be disposed in the body
							of the macro. The API is changed to tell with-fred-
							drawing which port of the actor we are dealing with.
	106	11/16/94	chip    	just a little arg fix in call-with-temp-string
	107	11/16/94	Hernan  	Redefining view-key-event-handler of sk8-fred to
							allow entering characters via direct calls to
							keyDown.
	108	11/16/94	dy      	move view-key-event-handler after the defclass of sk8-fred
	109	12/ 5/94	rod     	fixing bug in pointonwhichpart.
	110	12/ 9/94	Hernan  	Adding support for Fred color.
	111	12/ 9/94	Hernan  	Making textColor return the color.
	112	12/13/94	Hernan  	FindColor should return nil if the color is not
							found.
	113	12/13/94	till    	typo in setf textstyle
	114	12/13/94	Hernan  	The text font of EditText should be set after the 
							Fred component is set up so that it is copied from
							there and not from the plist (which is where 
							normal actors keep their textFonts).
	115	12/21/94	Hernan  	EditText should send the mouseup event.
	116	 1/17/95	Hernan  	1212106: setf horizontalScroll forces a redraw
							with the forceRedraw argument set to true to 
							force the innards of the field to redraw themselves.
	117	 1/20/95	Hernan  	1170352: adding home, page up, etc. funcionality.
							Also fixing holes in the whole informational part of
							the API. verticalScroll and set verticalScroll will
							both use lines from now on.
	118	 1/24/95	Hernan  	Using with-fast-node-slots where appropriate.
	119	 1/27/95	Hernan  	1207549: before calling mouseUp, the event vars
							are reset to the current state.
	120	 2/ 2/95	Hernan  	1169263: setSelection now causes an expensive redraw.
							Who knows why the caret behaves in such funny (strange)
							ways...
	121	 2/ 6/95	Hernan  	1215052: Keydown makes sure the thing given to it is a 
							character.
	122	 2/ 6/95	Hernan  	Fixing the previous comment to say the right thing.
	123	 2/ 6/95	Hernan  	mouseDown passes the event along when the field
							is not the eventActor.
	124	 2/17/95	Hernan  	handleKey redefined from what used to be
							ScriptEditText method.
	125	 3/ 1/95	Hernan  	Updating source to work with new Fred 3.0 code.
	126	 3/ 1/95	Hernan  	Copying font information correctly.
	127	 3/ 3/95	Hernan  	Trying to figure out why the field reverts to 
							Monaco when we restore SK8.
	128	 3/10/95	rod     	Checking in Hernan's fix to set-edit-text-font-spec.
	129	 3/10/95	dy      	Hernn sez: when a font attribute is changed, and the change affects the whole buffer,
							we also need to change the buffer's efont and cfont
	130	 3/15/95	Hernan  	editText-draw now calls frec-update to deal with
							fr.bwin being out of synch. This seems to be the
							cause of the buffer-position errors in the help
							window.
	131	 3/15/95	Hernan  	enteringStage of EditText has to make sure 
							fr.bwin is correct before setting the wptr.
	132	 3/22/95	Hernan  	Changed idle to clear the update region if it has 
							not been cleared by calling forceRedraw.
	133	 3/27/95	Hernan  	1232766: mouseDown of EditText propagates the
							event.
	134	 4/ 5/95	Hernan  	set verticalScroll updates the bwin if necessary.
	135	 4/14/95	Hernan  	update-bwin also checks the value of fr.selposns and
							marks it dirty.
	136	 4/14/95	Hernan  	updatePartnerScroller updates bwin just in case...
	137	 4/19/95	Hernan  	1241141: merge-with-current-font-spec is rewritten to 
							use MCL's code to parse font-specs.
	138	 4/25/95	Hernan  	Making tabInField not tab to next actor when modifier
							keys are pressed. Also added actorTextSize of EditText 
							which tells you how big the field should be to show all its 
							text. This is version 1: the slow one.
	139	 4/25/95	Hernan  	Now implementing the fast version of sk8-frec-size. Uses
							the cached information when it can. Done!
	140	 4/26/95	sidney  	actorTextSize needed a keyword argument to match the other definitions
	141	 4/26/95	rod     	For now removing the actortextsize speedup as
							it does not work in all cases.
	142	 4/26/95	rod     	Making fred redraw after each and every 
							keystroke...for now.
	143	 4/26/95	Hernan  	Fixing the lingering caret problem from our side of the
							fence. We do all drawing into the main port (a gWorld if
							there is one). To blink the caret we have to blit to the
							window.
	144	 4/28/95	Hernan  	Changed with-fred-drawing to do nothing when the call
							is nested (with-fred-drawing should not be nested).
	145	 5/ 1/95	Hernan  	with-fred-drawing has to be able to be called in a nested
							fashion. I fixed the problem that prevented that. Each time
							we prepare to draw the field we compute the origin by
							subtracting the field's position from {0,0}. Not a problem 
							since we restore the origin at the end.
	146	 5/ 1/95	Hernan  	More fixes to with-fred-drawing. Has to deal with the case
							that the port has been disposed. The key is to resample the
							port at the end of the execution of the body.
	147	 5/ 1/95	Hernan  	ForceRedraw has to make sure the gWorld's
							origin is at 0 before blitting. Added with-zero-origin for this
							purpose.
	2  	 6/ 8/95	sidney  	MCL 3.0 changes
	3  	 6/23/95	Hernan  	1239905, and also making all editText's wantsIdle to false
						until they get activated.
	4  	 6/23/95	Hernan  	1254507
						1255882: needs to make sure frec is updated before this is called.
						Also added nextFontChange. This allows save as text to work.
	5  	 6/26/95	Hernan  	Fixing fred click weirdness introduced by 3.0b5 code.
	6  	 6/30/95	sidney  	add arguments to new-fred to support saving text styles 
						info with fred buffer
	7  	 7/ 5/95	Hernan  	Adding a view-mouse-position method for Sk8-fred.
	8  	 7/12/95	Hernan  	handleKey has to take ownership of the drawing lock.
	9  	 9/15/95	Hernan  	fill-in-buffer-text-info sets the buffer empty font, if the
						buffer only has 1 font for itself.
	10 	12/13/95	Hernan  	Need to redefine (setf fred-tabcount) of sk8-fred because
						the MCL version only works when the Fred is on the screen.
	11 	 1/26/96	sidney  	remove dependency of gs:call-with-temp-string of editText on lap code. Note that it no longer stack-allocates the temp string
	12 	 2/15/96	Brian   	Adding selectAll.
	2  	 4/10/96	Hernan  	define-system-handler->define-handler.
	4  	 4/22/96	Brian   	Fixing method congruency problems.
	5  	 5/ 2/96	Hernan  	Fixing with-fred-drawing to correctly allow EditText to 
						image when capturing its picture.
	6  	 5/ 7/96	sidney  	dont't use originalpropertyvalue. it was a no-op the way it was used anyway, and it shouldn't be defined yet when this is loaded
	7  	 5/ 8/96	Hernan  	Adding previousFontChange.
	8  	 5/ 8/96	Hernan  	fred-click only updates the scroller when it is done. This
						makes scrolling by hand a lot faster.
	9  	 6/11/96	Hernan  	with-fred-drawing has to deal with the nested case. The
						solution is to store the functions previous state. If the new
						state is the previous state, then we assume all the port and
						origin stuff is set up correctly and execute the body. If the
						port we are drawing is not the same, we do all the setup
						again.
	10 	 7/ 7/96	sidney  	changes for native PPC build
	11 	 7/26/96	Hernan  	Need to call update-cursor or else fred-click has a redraw
						error. Very embarrassing that we do not know why 
						refreshing the cursor fixes it...
	12 	 7/26/96	Hernan  	update-cursor -> setting the cursor of the Stage to ibeamCursor.
	13 	11/15/96	Hernan  	Initialize cannot assume that original is the Edittext parent.
						The EditText parent might be in the args as part of the
						otherParents list. If not, an error has to be signaled.
	14 	11/15/96	Hernan  	Abstracted out the code I added just above. The function is
						now called originalAncestor.
	15 	12/12/96	Hernan  	Fixed view-key-event-handler to use the character supplied when
						the character from the event record is null. This allows key events
						generated programmatically to work.
	16 	12/17/96	Brian Roddy	Adding robustness to setselection.
	17 	 2/27/97	Hernan
