This is the file ":SK8:Recompile Required Timestamp".

¥ A fasl is recompiled if:
   ¥ the fasl file modify time is older than the modify time of this file
   or
   ¥ all of the following are true:
     ¥ this file has a version number (revID field of 'ckid' resource), and
     ¥ the fasl has a master recompile version number stamped in it from a previous compile, and
     ¥ the former is < the latter.
   or
   other more obvious reasons, like the fasl doesn't exist.
¥ If you want to force a "recompile everything"
   ¥Êonly on your machine:
       Check the checkbox.  (When you click OK, this file is given a modify time of NOW.)
   ¥ on your machine and for everyone after their next "Update All":
       Check this file out/in.
¥ÊIf a "recompile everything" build dies, and you start again, the new build will
  continue the "recompile everything" from where it left off.  Checking
  the checkbox again will make the recompile start over from scratch.
¥ÊWhen you get a new version of this file by doing a SourceServer "Update", it
  will cause a "recompile everything" the next time you build.
¥ÊIf you want to see the reason for each recompile, set *verbose-compile-reason* to T.

The same tests are also used for deciding when to rebuild the SK8 and ProjectBuilder project files

							(this checkin is really to force a recompile of changed let+ macro)
	10 	 3/ 1/95	dy      	some macros were not working correctly.  While I was at it, I removed the information that was only of interest while we were transitioning to using this file.
	11 	 4/24/95	dy      	Timezone bug fix in Build Part 1 requires recompile anyway, so let's make it official.
	2  	 8/17/95	sidney  	Changed build to catch locally bound specials that are SK8 objects, and had to change some macros
